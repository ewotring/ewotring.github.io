            <h2>Sand Bags</h2>
                <p>Sand bags present a unique challenge. Since the load inside the bag shifts and changes shape, the weight is more difficult to pick up than, for example, a barbell. hand and lower arm strength tends to impose limitations with these implements. Nonetheless, they can make excellent training tools for strongman competitions.</p>

            <h2>Weight Vests</h2>
                <p>Weight vests simply add weight to the body of the athlete. Heavy loads can make even walking a strenuous exercise. Such vests can help to make bodyweight exercises more difficult, as well.</p>

            <h2>Atlas Stones</h2>
                <p>Mainly used in competition, Atlas stones are difficult to lift, because of their spherical shape. usually, the competed stones weigh more than 100 pounds. However, the dedicated athlete can make lighter stones by casting concrete with foam inserts. Conversely, heavier stones can be made by including metal weights. Of course, the size of the stone can also vary. Many historical feats of strength center around lifting stones to various heights or carrying them for various distances.</p>
