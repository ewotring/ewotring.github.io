    <h1>Implements for Strength Development</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Bodyweight</h2>
                <p>Bodyweight is always available, but not very adjustable. High-frequency training is possible. Leverage is the main way to adjust load and progress.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Kettlebells</h2>
                <p>Kettlebells have large jumps between weights. One of the best ways to progress with kettlebells is to increase training volume. This fits neatly with one of the classic lifts. The clean and press demands high volume to build strength. Kettlebells can easily be kept in the home for convenient use.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Barbells</h2>
                <p>The barbell allows the most adjustability of these three implements. As well, the barbell allows the largest intensity, or loading. While great strength can be built with kettlebells, a barbell is needed for maximal loading. Many barbell lifts can be built with lower volume than kettlebells require. Partly, this is due to the finer adjustability of load available with barbells. Without a garage or basement, one must usually visit a gym to use barbells, which limits their availability.</p>

    <p>Overall, this web site looks good. The authors use a lot of links and style elements. Many images are included, as well as strong tags for emphasis. The sections appear to be divided using div tags.</p>
