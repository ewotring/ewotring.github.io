    <h1>Implements</h1>
        <h2>Bodyweight</h2>
            <p>Bodyweight is always available, but not very adjustable. High-frequency training is possible. Leverage is the main way to adjust load.</p>
        <h2>Kettlebells</h2>
            <p>Kettlebells have large jumps between weights. One of the best ways to progress with kettlebells is to increase training volume. This fits neatly with one of the classic lifts. The clean and press demands high volume to build strength.</p>
        <h2>Barbells</h2>
            <p>The barbell allows the most adjustability of these three implements. As well, the barbell allows the largest intensity, or loading. While great strength can be built with kettlebells, a barbell is needed for maximal loading. Many barbell lifts can be built with lower volume than kettlebells require. Partly, this is due to the finer adjustability of load available with barbells.</p>
